# Hammerspoon

My hammerspoon config - trying to achieve some keyboard remapping and layering only by using hammerspoon and/or mac os settings.

It's not the best tool for the job but I have a few reasons for trying it.

Otherwise, I'd go straight for Kanata + Karabiner driver. Which I might still do at some point, as I don't want to implement home row mods in hammerspoon.
